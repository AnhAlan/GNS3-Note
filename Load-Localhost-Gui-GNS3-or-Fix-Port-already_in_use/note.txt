On Windows, all GNS3 login information is stored in the AppData folder.
 
Press Windows + R, type %appdata%, and press Enter, then go to Roaming → GNS3 → 2.2. 

Inside this folder, open the file gns3_server.ini with Notepad or any text editor. 

This file contains the username and password used by GNS3 for web UI login, and also allows you to change the default port (3080) if it conflicts with another program.

You can enable or disable authentication or modify HTTPS settings here. After making changes, restart GNS3 for them to take effect. 

This is the place to check or adjust login configuration if GNS3 asks for credentials when accessing http://localhost:3080.
