Copy the file CiscoIOUKeygen3f.py to the GNS3 VM (VMware).

SSH into the GNS3 VM and run:
python3 CiscoIOUKeygen3f.py

After running the script, a file named iourc.txt will be created
in the same directory.

Open iourc.txt, you will see something like:

[license]
hostname = abcdef1234567890;

Copy the entire license line (hostname = ...;)

Open GNS3 on the host machine.
Go to:
Edit -> Preferences -> IOS on UNIX

Paste the copied content into the IOU license (iourc) field.
Click Apply, then OK.

Now IOU images can run from the GNS3 VM.

Notes:
- The GNS3 VM must be running
- The license is tied to the VM, not the host
- If the VM is recreated, generate the license again
