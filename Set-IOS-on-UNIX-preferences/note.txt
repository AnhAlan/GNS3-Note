Copy the file CiscoIOUKeygen3f.py to the GNS3 VM (VMware).
SSH into the GNS3 VM and run the file using python3.

After running the script, a file named iourc.txt will be created in the same directory.
Open the iourc.txt file, you will see a line like:

gns3vm = "something" -> ( ex: gns3vm = "abcdxavava" copy all that )

Copy the text inside the quotation marks.

Open the GNS3 application on your host machine.
Go to Edit -> Preferences -> IOS on UNIX.
Paste the copied text into the IOU licence (iourc file) field.
Click Apply, then OK.

Now you can run IOU images from the GNS3 VM (VMware).

Notes:

The GNS3 VM must be running

The license is tied to the VM, not the host machine

If the VM is changed or recreated, generate the license again
